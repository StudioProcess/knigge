  //   3. <keyword>: { <decomposition>: <reassembly>, ... }
  //   4. <keyword>: { <decomposition>: [ <reassembly>, ... ], ... }
  // 
  // special characters:
  //   * ............. wildcard (in decomposition): represents arbitrary text
  //   #<tag> ........ tag (in decomposition): refer to tags e.g. #belief
  //   $<n> .......... parameter (in reassembly): refer to wildcards/tags in the
  //                   decomposition e.g. $1, $2 etc.
  //   = <keyword> ... jump marker (in reassembly) jump to another keyword
  //   @ ............. memory marker (at start of keyword or decomposition):
  //                   save reply from this keyword or decomposition for later,
  //                   when no keywords generate a reply. continue with next
